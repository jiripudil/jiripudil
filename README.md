# Hello 👋 I am Jiří Pudil

a software developer from 🇨🇿 Brno

**I’m a frequent flyer between client-side and server-side code.**

I have over a decade of experience with many aspects of software development for the web, which I enjoy sharing at [meetups and conferences](https://jiripudil.cz/talks) as well as through a [blog](https://jiripudil.cz/blog).

I'm the author and maintainer of several open-source tools, including but not limited to:

- [Naja](https://github.com/naja-js/naja), a modern AJAX library for Nette Framework;
- [contributte/webpack](https://github.com/contributte/webpack), a Webpack adapter for Nette Framework;
- [jiripudil/otp](https://github.com/jiripudil/otp), a library that generates and verifies one-time passwords;
- [jiripudil/phpstan-sealed-classes](https://github.com/jiripudil/phpstan-sealed-classes), a PHPstan extension adding support for sealed class hierarchies.

I also contribute to packages that I use, whenever I find a bug or come up with a feature I'd like the package to have. Perhaps the most notable are my [contributions to PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Ajiripudil).

You can [❤️ sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/jiripudil) if you like what I do!
