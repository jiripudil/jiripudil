# Hello 👋 I am Jiří Pudil

I'm a software developer from Brno, CZ 🇨🇿

I am most proficient with modern PHP using Nette Framework, and TypeScript with Node.js and React, with a bit of this and that on the side, including Python, Rust, Kotlin, or Swift.

I'm the author and maintainer of several open-source tools, including but not limited to:

- [Naja](https://github.com/naja-js/naja), a modern AJAX library for Nette Framework,
- [contributte/webpack](https://github.com/contributte/webpack), a Webpack adapter for Nette Framework,
- [contributte/validator](https://github.com/contributte/validator), an integration of Symfony's Validator component into Nette Framework.

I also contribute to packages that I use, whenever I find a bug or come up with a feature I'd like the package to have.

You can [❤️ sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/jiripudil) if you like what I do!
