# Hello üëã I am Ji≈ô√≠ Pudil

> I turn ‚òï into `<code />`

I'm a web developer proficient with modern [PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src) using [Nette Framework](https://github.com/nette), and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

I'm the author and maintainer of several open-source tools, including but not limited to:

- [Naja](https://github.com/jiripudil/Naja), a modern AJAX library for Nette Framework,
- [contributte/webpack](https://github.com/contributte/webpack), a Webpack adapter for Nette Framework,
- [contributte/validator](https://github.com/contributte/validator), an integration of Symfony's Validator component into Nette Framework.

I also contribute to packages that I use, whenever I find a bug or come up with a feature I'd like the package to have.
